# belly-button-challenge: Examining the biodiversity of the humble human navel

For this assignment, an interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which catalogoues the microbes that colonise human navels. 

## Brief Introduction to the Dataset
The Belly Button Biodiversity project was launched to examine the microbes that call our navels home and investigate the factors that might affect their ability to survive and thrive in such environments.

Subjects who donated samples to this study were based in North America.

## Dashboard Functions
Explore whether washing frequency, operationalised as intentional scrubs per week, influences the propensity for certain microbes to thrive.
